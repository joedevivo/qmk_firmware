## New Haven Display 

[New Haven Display](http://www.newhavendisplay.com) is what the Infinity Ergodox
uses, and I felt no need to make a change there. I ordered my LCDs from digikey,
but direct from NHD is the only way to get the adapter board. These LCDs are
designed to be PCB mounted, and I wasn't interested in Handwiring them. Since
they're gonna hit you for $15 in shipping, might as well get the LCD there too.

## OSHPark

* 1 Controler PCB **TODO**: I'm still in the prototyping phase, but the way to do this will
  eventually be ordering a PCB I've designed from OSHPark. This is a placeholder
  until then.
* Teensy 3.2. OSHPark's are purple. I know you can't see it, but it'll match
  this board and that's hot.
* (MAYBE) I might make a custom PCB for the NHD too, to get out of that $15 shipping.

## Other

## Arrow

The UI is definitely an issue at [arrow dot com](https://arrow.com), but the
free overnight shipping is killer. TBH, free economy shipping from digikey or
mouser would be enough to win me back.

* 6 [Molex 0039532135](https://www.arrow.com/en/products/0039532135/molex).
  These connectors will be soldered to the PCB. There are 6 physical key
  matricies that are coming into the PCB, but as of the Advantage2, they all use
  the same connector.
* 1 [Adafruit 2946](https://www.arrow.com/en/products/2946/adafruit-industries).
  This is an LED Matrix driver. YAS! We're gonna backlight a Kinesis!
* LEDs for backlight (Your choice!) There are no LEDs for status. That's the
  LCD's job.

## TODO:

* 2 2x5 header pin set 
* 1 2x5 F2F cable
